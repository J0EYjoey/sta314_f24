# Polynomial Regression

## Fit polynomial regressions

We first fit the polynomial regression model using the following
command:

```{r}
fit <- lm(wage ~ poly(age,4), data=Wage)  # by default, the "poly" function use orthogonal polynomials
coef(summary(fit))
```

This syntax fits a linear model, using the `lm()` function, in order to
predict wage using a 4-degree polynomial in age: `poly(age,4)`. The
`poly()` command allows us to avoid having to write out a long formula
with powers of age. The function returns a matrix whose columns are a
basis of orthogonal polynomials, which essentially means that each
column is a linear combination of the variables age, age\^2, age\^3 and
age\^4.

```{r}
fit_raw <- lm(wage ~ poly(age,4,raw=T), data=Wage) # use raw polynomial x, x^2,x^3,...
coef(summary(fit_raw))
```

There are alternative ways of constructing polynomial features

```{r}
fit_raw_alternative <- lm(wage ~ age+I(age^2)+I(age^3)+I(age^4), data=Wage) # recall that we shouldn't drop I()
coef(fit_raw_alternative)   # compare with the coefficients of fit_raw

```

```{r}
# another option
fit_raw_alternative_2 <- lm(wage ~ cbind(age, age^2, age^3, age^4), data=Wage)
coef(fit_raw_alternative_2) 
```

## Prediction

We now create a grid of values for age at which we want predictions, and
then call the generic `predict()` function, specifying that we want
standard errors as well.

```{r}
# Get min/max values of age using the range() function
agelims <- range(age)

# Generate a sequence of age values spanning the range
age_grid <- seq(from = agelims[1], to = agelims[2])  

 
# Predict the value of the generated ages,
# returning the standard error using se = TRUE
preds = predict(fit, newdata = list(age = age_grid), se = TRUE)

# Obtain confidence interval for fitted value, i.e. compute error bands (2*SE) 
se_bands = cbind("upper" = preds$fit+2*preds$se.fit, 
                 "lower" = preds$fit-2*preds$se.fit)

```

Finally, we plot the data and add the fit from the degree-4 polynomial.

```{r}
# Plot the data points
plot(age, wage, xlim=agelims, cex=.5, col="darkgrey") 
title("Degree-4 Polynomial", outer=T)
lines(age_grid, preds$fit, lwd=2, col="blue") # plot the fitted values per grid point
matlines(age_grid, se_bands, lwd=1, col="blue", lty=3) # plot the confidence intervals per grid point

```

A fancier way of using ggplot.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = Wage, aes(x = age, y = wage)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = age_grid, y = preds$fit), color = "#0000FF") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = age_grid, 
                  ymin = se_bands[,"lower"], 
                  ymax = se_bands[,"upper"]), 
              alpha = 0.3) +
  xlim(agelims) +
  labs(title = "Degree-4 Polynomial")
```

We mentioned earlier that whether or not an orthogonal set of basis
functions is produced in the poly() function will not affect the model
obtained in a meaningful way. What do we mean by this? The fitted values
obtained in either case are identical (up to a miniscale rounding error
caused by building our models on a computer).

To verify this, we can also derive the fitted wages according to
fit_raw, which is the regression model using raw polynomials

```{r}
preds_raw <- predict(fit_raw, newdata = list(age=age_grid), se=TRUE)
```

We then calculate the largest difference between the two estimates,
print out the first few values.

```{r}
max(abs(preds$fit - preds_raw$fit))
```

## Fit a logistic model with polynomial regressions

```{r}
fit_logis <- glm(I(wage>250) ~ poly(age,4), data=Wage, family=binomial) # what's the modelling assumption behind?
preds_logis <- predict(fit_logis, newdata=list(age=age_grid), se=T) # fitted values of logits
pfit <- exp(preds_logis$fit)/(1+exp(preds_logis$fit)) # estimated probability by applying inverse-logit transformation to the fitted logits
```

```{r}
# create confidence intervals in the logit scale
se_bands_logit = cbind("upper" = preds_logis$fit+2*preds_logis$se.fit, 
                       "lower" = preds_logis$fit-2*preds_logis$se.fit)   

# transform confidence intervals to P(y=1|x)
se_bands <- exp(se_bands_logit)/(1+exp(se_bands_logit)) 
```

```{r}
plot(age, I(wage>250), xlim=agelims, type="n", ylim=c(0,.3))
points(jitter(age), I((wage>250)/5), cex=.5, pch="|", col="darkgrey") # plot the data points, with noise added into age for better visualization
lines(age_grid, pfit, lwd=2,  col="blue") # plot the fitted probabilities
matlines(age_grid, se_bands, lwd=1, col="blue", lty=3) # plot the confidence intervals
```

A fancier way of using `ggplot2`.

```{r}
high = Wage %>%
  filter(wage > 250)

low = Wage %>%
  filter(wage <= 250)

ggplot() +
  geom_rug(data = low, aes(x = jitter(age), y = wage), sides = "b", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_rug(data = high, aes(x = jitter(age), y = wage), sides = "t", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = age_grid, y = pfit), color = "#0000FF") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = age_grid, 
                  ymin = se_bands[,"lower"], 
                  ymax = se_bands[,"upper"]), 
              alpha = 0.3) +
  xlim(agelims) +
  ylim(c(0,.3)) +
  labs(title = "Degree-4 Polynomial",
       x = "Age",
       y = "P(wage > 250)")
```

We have drawn the age values corresponding to the observations with wage
values above 250 as gray marks on the top of the plot, and those with
wage values below 250 are shown as gray marks on the bottom of the plot.
We used the `jitter()` function to jitter the age values a bit so that
observations with the same age value do not cover each other up. This is
often called a rug plot.

# Step functions

In order to fit a step function, we use the `cut()` function:

```{r}
table(cut(age, 4))  # obtain cut points and supporting intervals of age 
fit_step <- lm(wage ~ cut(age,4), data=Wage) # the predictors are indicators
coef(summary(fit_step))
```

Here `cut()` automatically picked the cut-points at 33.5, 49, and 64.5
years of age. We could also have specified our own cut-points directly
using the breaks option. The function `cut()` returns an ordered
categorical variable; the `lm()` function then creates a set of dummy
variables for use in the regression. The age\<33.5 category is left out,
so the intercept coefficient of \$94,160 can be interpreted as the
average salary for those under 33.5 years of age, and the other
coefficients can be interpreted as the average additional salary for
those in the other age groups.

We can produce predictions and plots just as we did in the case of the
polynomial fit.

```{r}
# Predict the value of the generated ages, returning the standard error using se = TRUE
preds = predict(fit_step, newdata = list(age = age_grid), se = TRUE)

# Compute error bands (2*SE)
se_bands = cbind("upper" = preds$fit+2*preds$se.fit, 
                 "lower" = preds$fit-2*preds$se.fit)

# Plot
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = Wage, aes(x = age, y = wage)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = age_grid, y = preds$fit), color = "#0000FF") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = age_grid, 
                  ymin = se_bands[,"lower"], 
                  ymax = se_bands[,"upper"]), 
              alpha = 0.3) +
  xlim(agelims) +
  labs(title = "Step Function")
```

# Splines

In order to fit regression splines in R, we use the splines library.

```{r}
library(splines)
```

Regression splines can be fit by constructing an appropriate matrix of
basis functions.

The `bs()` function generates the entire matrix of `bs()` basis
functions for splines with the specified set of knots. By default, cubic
splines are produced. Fitting wage to age using a regression spline is
simple:

```{r}
fit_splines <- lm(wage ~ bs(age, knots=c(25,40,60)), data=Wage) # by default, bs creates cubic spline
pred_splines <- predict(fit_splines, newdata=list(age=age_grid), se=T)
```

```{r}
# plot data points, fitted values and confidence intervals
plot(age, wage, col="gray")
lines(age_grid, pred_splines$fit,lwd=2)
lines(age_grid, pred_splines$fit+2*pred_splines$se, lty="dashed")
lines(age_grid, pred_splines$fit-2*pred_splines$se, lty="dashed")
```

Here we have prespecified knots at ages 25, 40, and 60. This produces a
spline with six basis functions. (Recall that a cubic spline with three
knots has seven degrees of freedom; these degrees of freedom are used up
by an intercept, plus six basis functions.) We could also use the `df`
option to produce a spline with knots at uniform quantiles of the data.

```{r}
dim(bs(age, knots=c(25,40,60))) # 3 knots has 6 basis functions
dim(bs(age, df=6)) # specify the number of basis function and R will place knots with equal quantiles
attr(bs(age, df=6),"knots") # here is the location of knots
```

Natural splines can be fitted by using `ns`. Recall that natural splines
are linear beyond the boundary knots.

```{r}
fit_nsplines <- lm(wage ~ ns(age, df=6), data=Wage) # fit natural cubic spline with 6 degrees 
pred_nsplines <- predict(fit_nsplines, newdata=list(age=age_grid), se=T)

# plot
plot(age, wage, col="grey")
lines(age_grid, pred_nsplines$fit,col="red",lwd=2)
```

# Local regression (kernel smoothing)

Fit local polynomial smoothing regression by `loess()`.

```{r}
# span=0.2 means the neighborhood includes 20% points 
fit_lr2 <- loess(wage ~ age, span=.2, data=Wage)  # we can also specify the degree of polynomials
# What about span=0.5
fit_lr5 <- loess(wage ~ age, span=.5, data=Wage)

# prediction can be done by the predict() function.
pred_lr2 <- predict(fit_lr2, data.frame(age=age_grid))
pred_lr5 <- predict(fit_lr5, data.frame(age=age_grid))
```

Make the plot of fitted lines.

```{r}
# make plots
plot(age, wage, xlim=agelims, cex=.5, col="darkgrey")
title("Local Regression")
lines(age_grid, pred_lr2, col="red", lwd=2)
lines(age_grid, pred_lr5, col="blue", lwd=2)
legend("topright", legend=c("Span=0.2","Span=0.5"), col=c("red","blue"),
       lty=1, lwd=2, cex=.8)
```

# Generalized Additive Models: GAMs

When fitting a GAM, we can manually specify the features.

```{r}
# example: create natural spline basis and fit a linear model
gam1 <- lm(wage~ ns(year,4) + ns(age,5) + education, data=Wage) 
```

Alternatively, we can use the `gam` function.

```{r}
#example: in gam, we can also use local regression lo().
library(gam)

gam2 <- gam(wage~ ns(year,4) + lo(age,span=0.7)+education, data=Wage) 

# `predict()` method for the class Gam. Here we make predictions on the training set.
preds <- predict(gam2, newdata = Wage) 
```

```{r}
plot(gam2, se=TRUE, col="green") # plots for functions that are applied to each predictor/variable
```

## Fit GAMs for logistic regression

In order to fit a logistic regression GAM, we once again use the `I()`
function in constructing the binary response variable, and set
`family=binomial`.

```{r}
gam.lr <- gam(I(wage>250) ~ year + ns(age,df=5) + education, family=binomial, data=Wage)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(gam.lr, se=T, col="green")
```

There is no high earners in the \< HS category

```{r}
table(education, I(wage>250)) 
```

Hence, we fit a logistic regression GAM using all but this category.
This provides more sensible results.

```{r}
# refit the model
gam.lr.s <- gam(I(wage>250) ~ year + ns(age,df=5) + education, family=binomial, data=Wage, subset=(education!="1. < HS Grad"))
plot(gam.lr.s, se=T, col="green")
```
